Develop a simple application that can search and extract movie information using API from
https://www.omdbapi.com/. Request for an API key from the following URL
https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx. Once registered test your API and the request should return
a JSON data response. Based on the response build an application that allows users to search and
display the movie data.
